## Description 

A fully responsive full-stack web application that allows the user to log either cardio or resistance exercises they have completed during each workout. Users can log multiple workouts in a day and can log multiple exercises per workout. The front end utilises HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap. The back end utilises Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB & Mongoose for the data storage.

The home page displays the last workout the user logged and displays the total time duration of the workout and also the total weight lifted if there were any resistance exercises in the workout. The user is given the choice of either continuing the workout or starting a new workout.
